# Resources used in our framework

There aren't many people out there who develop software for libraries (academic, public, private). This organisation is an attempt to gather as much code in one place for folks that do. Shortlist of apps to implement:

- course reserves
- library hours & locations
- support classes that are used in these projects (this repository)
